# PyModMonLCD
Python Modbus Monitor on Raspberry Pi with LCD output for solar systems 

The script provides a GUI wich will allow you to set up a ini-file for the channels to monitor (e.g. on a PC)
The script can then run on a Raspberry Pi without a monitor and will display the data on a LCD.

The data layout is fixed at the time of this writing.
Feel free to change it to your liking.
